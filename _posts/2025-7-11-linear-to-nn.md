Linear Regression is all about lines of best fit for a given dataset. But how do we find lines of best fit? Here is a quick answer:

> 1. Start with a random line
> 2. For each data point in dataset

> a) Find how “close” the line is to the point
> 
> b) Depending on how close/far the line is, move the line a step towards the point

Step 2 can be repeated multiple times (called **epochs**)

In 3D, a “line of best fit” is a plane of best fit. And in higher dimensions? That’s when we get into **neural networks**. And once we represent our models as networks, we can start doing high-dimensional **curves of best fit**.

**But how do neural networks get trained? Why use neural networks? Watch the video to know more!**
