When I think of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), only one concept comes to mind: **time series**. What is a time series? Stock price values over the year, music notes in a symphony, and, yes, even sentences of a language are all in the form of a time series. In each of these examples of data, one data point is intentionally after another, forming a sequence that can be interpreted over time. How do we have ML deal with this data?
