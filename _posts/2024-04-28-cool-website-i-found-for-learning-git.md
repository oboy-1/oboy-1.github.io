[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control tool – it allows you to keep track and save/backup different versions of your project. Now I learned about Git the hard way – by not using it, and then regretting that I didn’t after I lost my code :D. And once I started using Git, it took a good amount of time for me to start using it *correctly* (I’ll admit that it it took some time for me to realize on how to use branches)!

I wish I had seen [this website](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) when I was getting started. It teaches you Git through different levels, and also shows you a dynamic visual diagram as you type commands to help you best understand what they do.

If you want to learn Git, please check this out! Thank you to the people behind **[learnGitBranching](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching)** for making this tool!
