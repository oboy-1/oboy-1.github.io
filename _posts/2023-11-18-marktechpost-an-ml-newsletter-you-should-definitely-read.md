I enjoy reading the news – I read both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times daily. But when it came to Machine Learning content, I was looking for a news site that provided the same, daily news format that the newspapers give. That is when I came across MarkTechPost!

MarkTechPost is a news platform which provides paper summaries on recent research. What sets MarkTechPost apart from my perspective is the fact that MarkTechPost doesn’t shy away from explaining the technical aspect of the research while still putting the research into the larger context of AI/ML and beyond. MarkTechPost goes over all kinds of topics in ML – from LLM research to breakthroughs in Computer Vision – and even provide tips on the tools and resources ML engineers (and aspiring ML engineers) should use.

**If you want to stay up to date with ML – this is the way!**
