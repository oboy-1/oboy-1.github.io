If you are looking for amazing, conceptual videos on Machine Learning, check out **StatQuest**! Unlike other channels, StatQuest assumes that you have no math experience! Every calculation is **intuitively explained**, and yet no method is simply abstracted from/obscured. I have used StatQuest for a lot of my ML Club lessons – and you should definitely watch those videos too!

I particularly loved his Natural Language Processing unit and his videos on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE, as I found these topics especially complicated (and other resources didn’t really explain them that simply). I have included the specific videos and the channel link below.
