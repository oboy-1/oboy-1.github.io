Recurrent Neural Networks, meet your successor! The problem with Recurrent Neural Networks is that they cannot handle predicting effectively over long time series. To solve this problem, researchers came up with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) â€“ which as the name suggests, keeps track of both long term and short term memory when doing prediction. Watch the video to learn more!
