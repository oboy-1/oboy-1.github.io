When you look at a face, what do you see? You see eyes, ears, a nose, and other facial features. When a computer normally looks at a photo of a face, it sees pixels – individual blocks of color arranged in an organized array. But this method isn’t as effective as our “human” method is – even from a deep-learning perspective. Therefore, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – which use sliding windows – to pick up on *features* rather than *pixels,* and to find relationships *between* different parts of the image to make their prediction.

These CNNs are used everywhere – they are the very foundation of today’s computer vision models, being used in applications from facial recognition to self-driving cars!
